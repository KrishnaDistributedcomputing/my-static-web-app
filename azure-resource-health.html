    <h1>Azure Service Health Documentation</h1>
    <p>Azure Service Health is a suite of experiences that provide personalized guidance and support when issues in Azure services are or may affect you in the future. Azure Service Health is composed of Azure status, the service health service, and Resource Health.</p>
    
    <div class="section">

        <h3>Azure Service Health service</h3>
        <p>Azure Service Health provides personalized information about the health of your Azure services. It helps you diagnose and get support for issues affecting your resources. Azure Service Health can be accessed from the Azure portal.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section" id="azure-status">
        <h3>Azure status</h3>
        <p>Azure status informs you of service outages in Azure on the Azure Status page. The page is a global view of the health of all Azure services across all Azure regions. The status page is a good reference for incidents with widespread impact, but it is recommended that current Azure users leverage Azure service health to stay informed about Azure incidents and maintenance.</p>

    <div class="section" id="service-health-portal">
        <h3>Service health portal</h3>
        <p>The Service Health portal provides a personalized view of the health of the Azure services and regions you're using. It is the best place to look for service-impacting communications about outages, planned maintenance activities, and other health advisories. The authenticated Service Health experience knows which services and resources you currently use.</p>

    <div class="section" id="resource-health">
        <h3>Resource Health</h3>
        <p>Resource Health provides information about the health of your individual cloud resources, such as a specific virtual machine instance. Using Azure Monitor, you can configure alerts to notify you of availability changes to your cloud resources. Resource Health, along with Azure Monitor notifications, helps you stay better informed about the availability of your resources minute by minute and quickly assess whether an issue is due to a problem on your side or related to an Azure platform event.</p>
